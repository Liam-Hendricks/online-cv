            I am a recent Computer system graduate from CPUT, with a full yearsâ€™
            worth of industry work experience.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/> I am  experienced in using the systems development life cycle (SDLC)
            method when working on new projects and maintaining or integrating
            into existing ones.
            <br/>
            <br/> I enjoy working on teams and am not afraid to  take initiative in order to learn new things to accomplish what is
            required and may be required.
